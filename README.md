# Bumblebob

Software stack of our second autonomous car

## Overview

Project bobtimus is the software project for High-Octane Motorsport e.Vs second autonomous race car, FAUmax byssa. The project name is a combination of [bumblebee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumblebee_(Transformers)) "optimus") and the name [bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_(given_name) "bob"). It is based on the established `transformer + bob` naming convention, that even we as the creators cannot explain.

As I cannot put all of the code online, I present the nodes I mainly worked on of the area motion planning and control.
